## Welcome to our analysis
Here's how we analyzed the data in the [manuscript](https://github.com/ktlab-project/mutation-order).

### Web appilication
We have created a web app so that you can easily adapt the results of our analysis to your own patients. We strongly believe that if we can predict the next mutation in patients, it will lead to the risk stratification and the treatment strategies of pre-acquisition mutations targeting.
