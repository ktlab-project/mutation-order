# Mutation order probabilities for predicting clonal heterogeneity and treatment response by single-cell analysis
The landscape of mutation order probabilities in AML by single-cell DNA-sequencing. Please refer to our publication for details.


### OVERVIEW
This dipository includes codes for processing dataset into the probabilities of mutation order that clonal hematopoiesis acquire mutations to contribute leukemogenesis, as described in our original paper. In addition, the Web Application is provided.


### WEBAPP
This map provides the novel perspectives firstly for risk stratification, secondly for treatment strategies of pre-acquisition mutations targeting, and thirdly would for predicting treatment response.
